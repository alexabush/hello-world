# hello-world
first github thingie. Woo!
Hi I'm alex. I have green eyes and like the rain in moderation. I definately
liked the rain a lot more as a kid. I think my declining interest in the
rain has to do with me carrying around a lot of electronics these days.
I have to worry about them getting wet and ruined and it's rather stressful.
Anyways, I hope you enjoy your day. Cheers!
